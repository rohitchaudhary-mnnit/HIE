Help It's Emergency

This Repository contains 2 folders HIE-FrontEnd and HIE-Backend which are the frontend and backend code of the project.

The HIE-BackEnd exposes the RESTAPI at localhost:8080/api/serviceproviders providing the essential services.

The HIE-FrontEnd is a react application which consumes the API and produces the data in UI.
